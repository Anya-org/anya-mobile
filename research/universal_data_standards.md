# Universal Blockchain Data Standards Research

This document summarizes the research on universal blockchain data standards, including FINOS, open banking/finance standards, and other relevant regulations.

## FINOS (Fintech Open Source Foundation)

FINOS is a foundation focused on promoting open source in the financial services industry. While it does not have a specific set of "blockchain standards," it has several projects that could be relevant to the development of a multi-layer Bitcoin wallet:

*   **Common Domain Model (CDM):** A project to create a standard representation of financial transactions. This could be a valuable resource for designing the wallet's data models, especially for complex transactions or integrations with traditional financial systems.
*   **Open RegTech Initiative:** An initiative focused on using open source to address regulatory challenges. This could be relevant for ensuring the wallet complies with financial regulations.
*   **FDC3 (Financial Desktop Connectivity and Collaboration Consortium):** A project focused on interoperability between financial applications on the desktop. While not directly related to the blockchain back-end, it could provide useful concepts for the wallet's front-end architecture, especially for a desktop version.

## Open Banking/Finance Standards

Open banking is a framework for securely sharing customer banking data with third-party financial service providers. While there isn't a direct "open banking standard for crypto wallets," the principles are highly relevant:

*   **Secure Data Sharing:** Open banking relies on APIs to share data securely. This is a good model for how the wallet could interact with external services, such as exchanges or DeFi protocols.
*   **Customer Consent:** Open banking puts the customer in control of their data. This is a core tenet of self-custodial crypto wallets.
*   **Interoperability:** Open banking aims to create a more interconnected financial ecosystem. This aligns with the goal of creating a multi-layer Bitcoin wallet that can interact with various protocols.

## Conclusion

A universal data standard for blockchains does not appear to exist at this time. However, by drawing on the principles and projects from FINOS and the open banking movement, we can design a wallet that is secure, interoperable, and well-structured.

For the wallet's architecture, this means:

*   **Adopting a modular, API-driven design.** This will make it easier to integrate with different layers, protocols, and services.
*   **Prioritizing user control and data privacy.**
*   **Staying informed about emerging standards and regulations** in the digital asset space.
